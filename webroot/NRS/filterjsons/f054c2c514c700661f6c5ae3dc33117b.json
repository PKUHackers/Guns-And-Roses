  "cleanContent": "GENEVA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The UN-Arab League joint envoy to Syria Kofi Annan has invited governments with influence to \"twist arms\" to implement the six-point plan in order to stop the escalating violence, his spokesman Ahmad Fawzi said on Tuesday.\"It is totally unacceptable and it must stop. And that is why Annan has invited governments with influence to raise the bar to another level, to the highest level possible, and twist arms if necessary to get the parties to implement the plan,\" Fawzi told reporters.He said that he hoped the contact group meeting, called by Russia, \"will take place soon.\"\"What is lacking is implementation and that is why we count on these member states with influence on the parties - during this meeting, and as a result of this meeting - to put irrevocable pressure on the parties to implement the plan and stop the killing and begin a political transition,\" he added.The Syrian army on Monday regained control of the rebel-held areas in Homs, a central province which has emerged as a major battleground between Syrian government forces and armed rebels in recent months.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
