  "cleanContent": "By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishChinese Defense Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng faced media at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office Tuesday morning, relating issues and concerns over the ongoing South China Sea disputes.When asked by a Sky News reporter whether China would launch a war, Geng said China has indisputable sovereign rights over the South China Sea islands and their adjacent waters, and the country opposes any military intervention in this area.“China has established a regular combat-ready patrol system in the waters under China\u0027s jurisdiction, and we will fulfill our duties in accordance with relevant regulations,” said Geng.When a NBC reporter popped the question about the China’s increasing “assertiveness” in its security and diplomatic policy in East Asia, Geng said China set up the regular patrol system to maintain the country\u0027s territorial sovereignty and safeguard its maritime rights, and it is not targeting a third country or any specific goals.“Standing up for a nation’s sovereign rights and standing as aggressive should never be confused, which will not hold water,” Geng added.Related news:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
