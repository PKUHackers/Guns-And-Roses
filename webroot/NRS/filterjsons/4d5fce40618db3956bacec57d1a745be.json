Yang reaffirmed his country\u0027s historical claim that Japan tricked his country into signing a treaty ceding the islands in 1895.\"The moves taken by Japan are totally illegal and invalid. They can in no way change the historical fact that Japan stole Diaoyu and its affiliated islands from China and the fact that China has territorial sovereignty over them,\" said the Chinese minister.Yang\u0027s speech came two days after stern talks he held with Japan\u0027s Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba on the dispute.(Agencies)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
