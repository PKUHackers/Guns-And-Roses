They are suspected of landing on the island at around 9:20 a.m. on Sept. 18 without legitimate purpose, the police said.Although some Japanese nationals landed on the islands before, the Japanese police had refrained from building a case.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
