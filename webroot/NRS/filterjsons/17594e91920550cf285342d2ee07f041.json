He warned last month that plans by the Tokyo municipal government to buy the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea could trigger an \"extremely grave crisis\" between the two powers.The ambassador was recalled to Tokyo on July 15 by Japan’s foreign minister Koichiro Gemba for discussions amid simmering tension over Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, requiring the envoy to \"accurately convey\" Tokyo\u0027s stance to Beijing.Uichiro Niwa, a former chairman of the Itochu trading conglomerate, became the first Japanese ambassador to Beijing appointed from the private sector in June 2010.A foreign affairs official said the he will likely be removed of his duties after September 29. The Japanese government is now looking for a candidate to succeed him.
