(Xinhua/Lu Zhe)\u003c/h4\u003e\t\t JIUQUAN, Oct. 31 -- A China manned space program  spokeswoman said here Monday that the unmanned spacecraft Shenzhou-8 is  scheduled to be launched at 5:58 a.m. Tuesday.A modified Long March-2F rocket, the fuel of which is being refilled,  will carry the spacecraft from the launch pad at the Jiuquan Satellite  Launch Center in northwest desert areas, spokeswoman Wu Ping said.Wu said technical conditions of all systems are normal, interfaces of  different systems are coordinated, ground tests are adequate,  contingency plans are ready and all facilities are sound, which meet  requirements for a launch.Shenzhou-8 is expected to dock with an experimental space module  Tiangong-1 that was put into orbit on Sept. 29. The practice will take  place within two days after the launch of Shenzhou-8, the latest step in  what will be a decade-long effort to place a manned permanent space  station in orbit.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
