  "cleanContent": "By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishIn the preface of its annual defense white paper, Japanese Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto wrote that China has increased its defense spending and rapidly sped up its military build-up and modernization. He also highlighted China\u0027s frequent activities in seas near Japan.The 2012 white paper is expected to be released today. Reporters who got a copy noticed that among all the countries included in the paper, Japan singled out China in particular, reciting ‘potential risks’ China poses to the region.The paper claimed that China\u0027s defense budget has risen 30-fold in the past 24 years; Chinese navy warships ‘frequent’ the Pacific; and the international community is worried about lack of transparency in China’s military spending, to list a few.Gao Hong, an expert on Japan affairs at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Global Times that there is nothing new in the 2012 report and as it always did, Japan is again attempting to exaggerate China threat and guide world opinions in its favor.Some observers say Japan’s hard-line stance over recent territorial disputes is gaining support at home. In South Korean media, The Segye Times warned that militarism seems to be reviving in Japan.The Hankyoreh said “we must remind Japan and the world as well that opening the ‘Pandora Box’ will undermine peace in Northeast Asia.”Related news:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
