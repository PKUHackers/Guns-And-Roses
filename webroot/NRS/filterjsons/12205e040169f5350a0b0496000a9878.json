  "cleanContent": "By Wang Qi, Sina EnglishA leader of the non-governmental activist group, World Chinese Alliance in Defense of Diaoyu Islands(WCADDI), said Chinese vessels have departed from the mainland and might arrive at the disputed Diaoyu Islands in one or two days, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News on Thursday.The group, formed by non-governmental groups from Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, will go campaigning for China’s sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands.The leader said there is at least one vessel involved but gave no more details.The group held a protest Thursday near the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong against Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara\u0027s plan to purchase the islands.The “defending Diaoyus” group once planned to set sail earlier in this January. The plan was canceled because of the interception of a Hong Kong maritime department.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
