  "cleanContent": "NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- World 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop will briefly interrupt his training to compete at the Monaco Diamond League on Friday to gauge himself before moving on to London for the Olympics.Four years ago, Kiprop was disappointed to clinch silver at the Beijing Olympics having been edged out by a devastating sprint of Rashid Ramzi of Bahrain.But this time in London he will have good chances of landing the gold when Ramzi has tested positive for EPO.\"I want to win gold in London. I know I can be an Olympic champion, but that took so long to come and I have the chance to rectify that in London Games,\" he said.\"Everyone goes to the Olympics eying nothing but victory. But Kenya has a strong team, we have been consistent and now it is another opportunity to prove to the world what we can achieve,\" he added.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
