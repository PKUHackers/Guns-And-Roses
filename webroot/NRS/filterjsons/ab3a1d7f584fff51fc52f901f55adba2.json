His pull out in the 200m means he will miss both events at the London Olympics.The 2004 Olympic 100m champion Justin Gatlin also scratched from the 200m at the US trials after securing his London berth in the 100m last Sunday.Wallace Spearmon, who was disqualified from a bronze medal spot at the 2008 Olympics for a late-race lane violation, had the fastest qualifying time in the 200m at 20.17 seconds.Shawn Crawford, the 2004 Olympic champion and 2008 Olympic runner-up in the 200m, was fourth-fastest overall at 20.32.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
