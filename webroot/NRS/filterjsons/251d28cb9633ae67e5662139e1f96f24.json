  "cleanContent": "By Zhao Wei, Sina EnglishTakakazu Ishii, the governor of Toyama Prefecture said Wednesday they had been notified by China Southern Airlines that their planes would stop flying from Toyama to Beijing from Oct 28, which currently flies four times a week.China Southern Airlines didnâ€™t gave a reason for the service halt, while the Japan side believed it was caused by the recent tension between the two countries over the Diaoyu Islands dispute.A separate report from Fukushima government said that flights from Fukushima to Shanghai of China Eastern Airlines will also be halted, and the airline carrier\u0027s branch offices in Fukushima will be closed in late October.That came after China\u0027s biggest carrier, Air China, canceled 22 Japan-bound flights between September 26 and Oct. 7, according to China Daily. It also said the company was considering cancelling flights from Hangzhou and Wuhan to Japanese cities.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
