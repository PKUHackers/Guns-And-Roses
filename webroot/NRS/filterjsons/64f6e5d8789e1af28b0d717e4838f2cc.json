  "cleanContent": "US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u0027s Syria pointman Fred Hof was to meet top Russian diplomats Friday in a bid to persuade Moscow to back strongman President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s removal from power.The high-stakes talks come as pressure mounts on Russia -- a Soviet-era ally of Syria believed to have the world\u0027s greatest remaining influence on the regime -- to back a political transition that would ultimately see Assad go.Moscow has publicly distanced itself from Assad in recent weeks while still supplying his army with weapons and adamantly vowing to resist all calls for foreign military intervention aimed at halting the 15-month crisis.\"There will not be a Security Council mandate for outside intervention, I guarantee you that,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Thursday on the sidelines of a trip to Kazakhstan by President Vladimir Putin.Russia has made a counter-proposal met with great scepticism by the United States that would see regional players such as Iran sit down with world powers and try to negotiate a joint strategy suitable to all Syrians.But it has also refused to give up on Kofi Annan\u0027s tattered Syrian peace plan despite the international envoy\u0027s admission that alternatives may soon need to be sought.\"Clearly, the time has come to determine what more can be done to secure implementation of the plan -- and what other options exist to address the crisis,\" Annan told the UN General Assembly on Thursday.A diplomat present at his subsequent closed-door briefing to UN Security Council members said Annan also renewed calls for the major powers to warn Assad of \"clear consequences\" if he failed to comply with the peace plan.Russia argues that it has been pressing Assad\u0027s representatives on an almost daily basis and charges that open Arab world support for the rebels was just as big an obstacle to peace.(Agencies)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
