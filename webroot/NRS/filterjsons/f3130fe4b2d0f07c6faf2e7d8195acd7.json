The voting will start on May 7, and the electoral campaigns should come to an end 48 hours ahead of the voting.Analysts said bloody attacks that have rattled major Syrian cities recently and claimed the lives of dozens of civilians came to overshadow the parliamentary elections.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
