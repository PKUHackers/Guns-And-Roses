  "cleanContent": "By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishForeign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said today that two Japanese right-wingers’illegal landing on Chinese Dioayu Islands is a severe provocation and a violation of China’s sovereignty.He added that China has lodged a protest with Japan and urged the Japanese government to explain why it tolerates right-wingers’ actions.\"We urge Japan to take effective measures to stop actions that might aggravate the situation,\" Hong said, \"And meanwhile, China preserves the right to take further actions.\"Two Japanese land on Diaoyu Islands: reportJapan’s Maritime Safety Agency said two Japanese citizens landed on Diaoyu Islands at around 9:30 am (Local time), Jiji press reported Tuesday.The two Japanese, heads of a Kagoshima company, set sail form Japan’s Ishigaki Island to China’s Diaoyu Islands on Monday evening, according to local media.Japan’s Maritime Safety Agency confirmed this afternoon that the two have left the islands after being warned by coast guards.The Foreign Ministry announced on September 16 that China has decided to submit its Partial Submission Concerning the Outer Limits of the Continental Shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in the East China Sea to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental shelf under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the sea (UNCLOS).State Oceanic Administration also said technical preparations for the submission are close to completion.China submitted to the commission its preliminary information of the Outer Limits of the Continental Shelf beyond 200 Nautical Miles in May 2009, saying that “China is making preparations for the submission” and “will issue a submission at an appropriate date.”According to relevant provisions of the UNCLOS, if the continental shelf of a coastal state extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines, information on the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles shall be submitted by the coastal state to the commission.Chinese government said it is their long-standing position that “the natural prolongation of the continental shelf of China in the East China Sea extends to the Okinawa Trough, beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines.China may have to wait 20 to 30 years before its submission could be reviewed by the commission, but this does not affect China’s claim for its continental shelf rights in the East China Sea, said Zhang Haiwen, deputy director of the China Institute for Marine Affairs.Related news:Special Coverage:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
