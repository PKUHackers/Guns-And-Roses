[Shu Dong/for China Daily]\u003c/h4\u003e\t\tJIUQUAN, Gansu - China is making last-minute preparations to launch the country\u0027s first space laboratory module at the end of this week at a launch center in northwest China.The unmanned Tiangong-1 module was originally scheduled to be launched into low Earth orbit between September 27 and 30. However, the forecasted arrival of a cold air mass at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center has pushed the launch back to September 29 or 30, depending on weather and other factors.\"This is a significant test. We\u0027ve never done such a thing before,\" said Lu Jinrong, the launch center\u0027s chief engineer.A full ground simulation was conducted on Sunday afternoon to ensure that the module and its Long March 2F carrier rocket are prepared for the actual launch.Just one month ago, a Long March carrier 2C rocket malfunctioned and failed to send an experimental satellite into orbit. The Tiangong-1 mission was subsequently rescheduled in order to allow engineers to sort out any problems that might occur during the launch.The Tiangong-1 will stay in orbit for two years. During its mission, it will dock with China\u0027s Shenzhou-8, -9 and -10 spacecraft. Unmanned docking procedures will be essential for China\u0027s eventual goal of establishing a manned space station around 2020.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
