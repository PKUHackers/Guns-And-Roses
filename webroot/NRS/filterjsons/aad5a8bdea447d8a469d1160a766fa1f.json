Syria, however, has denied any involvement in the massacre and placed the blame on opposition fighters and extremist groups.The Syrian government said the massacre was waged by in the hands of the opposition that aimed to tarnish and frame the Syrian government ahead of the visit of special envoy Kofi Annan and the UN Security Council\u0027s meeting on the crisis.Meanwhile, the foreign ministry said that Syria still believes in the importance of dialogue based on equality and stressed diplomacy is a necessary tool to establish communication between countries in order to resolve all issues and bring back relations to normalcy.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
