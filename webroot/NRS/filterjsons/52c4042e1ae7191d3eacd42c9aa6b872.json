Moscow said the move was pre-scheduled and had no connection with the current situation in Syria.Earlier Thursday, Russia reaffirmed it would implement all military-technical contracts Moscow and Damascus signed in 2008.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
