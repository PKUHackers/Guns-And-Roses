  "cleanContent": "MOSCOW, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian cargo spacecraft Progress M-13M docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday after three days of flight, the Russian Mission Control Center said.The Progress M-13M, which is the last cargo spacecraft to the ISS in 2011, docked at 15:42 Moscow Time (1142 GMT), the center said.The space freighter delivered more than 2.6 tons of technical equipment, fuel, water and food supplies, as well as a small Chibis-M satellite designed to study lightning and thunderstorms in the Earth\u0027s atmosphere.The Progress M-13M is scheduled to stay in orbit for three months and will undock from the ISS on Jan. 25 to return to Earth.The Oct. 30 launch of the Progress M-13M was the first since the failed launch of a Progress M-12M cargo ship on Aug. 24 due to a rocket malfunction.Following the launch of Progress M-13M, a manned Soyuz TMA-22 with three astronauts aboard will fly to the ISS on Nov. 14. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
