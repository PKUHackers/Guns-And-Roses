But initial estimate indicates that it could be related to America\u0027s stance on the Diaoyu Islands dispute.  Nuland reiterated that the U.S. does not take position on the islands dispute.The U.S. hopes to see the problem solved through bilateral talks, and will continue to hope so, she said.She added she hopes no such impression will be exerted on others that U.S. is \"behind Japan\".\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
