  "cleanContent": "JIUQUAN, Gansu, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- China\u0027s first space docking will go on as planned despite the rescheduled launch of the unmanned space module Tiangong-1 following a satellite launching failure last month, according to a space program commander.The experimental space station will conduct the country\u0027s first-ever space docking with the Shenzhou-8 spacecraft, which is scheduled to be launched in November, said Niu Hongguang, deputy commander-in-chief of the country\u0027s manned space program.A Long March 2C rocket malfunctioned and failed to send the Shijian XI-04 satellite into orbit in August, forcing authorities to reschedule the launch of China\u0027s first experimental space station based on safety considerations, according to Niu, also a deputy head of the General Armament Department of the Chinese People\u0027s Liberation Army (PLA).The rescheduling of the Tiangong-1 mission is aimed at allowing engineers to sort out any problems that might occur during the launch, said Niu.Tiangong-1 is expected to dock with the Shenzhou-8, Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 spacecraft in forthcoming launches, paving the way for the country to achieve its goal of establishing a manned space station by 2020.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
