  "cleanContent": "By Zhao Wei, Sina EnglishJapanese chief cabinet secretary Osamu Fujimura said on Thursday that the government will make a decision very soon on the \"landing\" application on Diaoyu Islands sent in by members of the Japanese Congress, in time to hold a memorial ceremony on August 19 for the Japanese dead killed at the end of WWII.Osamu Fujimura said at a press conference that the Japanese government will discuss the landing issue under the principle of “safeguarding and administrating the Senkaku Islands (Chinese Diaoyu Islands) in stable and peaceful way”. According to Japan\u0027s Jiji News Agency, the Japanese government is trying to “come to a conclusion and explanation that could satisfy all parties.”In a separate report by the Mainichi Newspapers, a small jet named “Hope” met the public on August 9. The small jet, jointly purchased by Japan\u0027s Kyodo News Agency and Mainichi Newspapers, will be used for aerial photography while flying over the Diaoyu Islands.Related news:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
