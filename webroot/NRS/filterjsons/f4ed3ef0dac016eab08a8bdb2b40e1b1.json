If there are three or four players or teams from the same NOC, they will be drawn into different quarters of the draw.The draw for the 16-team mixed doubles, based on the rankings from June 11, will be held on July 31.Players can only enter the mixed doubles if they are competing in at least one of the other four events.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
