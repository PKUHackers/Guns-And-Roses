  "cleanContent": "By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishSingapore has denied that it supports the Philippines\u0027 claim over the disputed territories in the South China Sea.In a statement posted on the website of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, Singapore said \"there has been no change to Singapore\u0027s position\".\"When PM Lee (Hsien Loong) met (Philippine) President Aquino on 8 September 2012, he reiterated Singapore\u0027s consistent position, namely that we do not take sides on the merits or otherwise of the various specific disputes in the south China Sea,\" the MFA said.\"PM Lee called on all claimants to exercise restraint and for disputes to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law. We had made this clear after the 8 September meeting,\" the MFA added.The Philippine media made the report about the supposed support extended by Singapore to Manila based on statements made by the Aquino administration.A Jakarta-based Southeast Asian analyst has earlier told PhilStar.com that the Philippines may be unable to get the help it expects from its neighbors to resolve the territorial row, saying economic interest of countries in the region may be the deciding factor.Related news:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
