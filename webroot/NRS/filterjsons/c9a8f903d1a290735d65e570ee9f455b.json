  "cleanContent": "BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- China has formally begun its manned space station program, aiming to complete construction of a \"relatively large\" manned space laboratory around 2020, said a spokesman for the national manned space program.China was aiming to develop and launch the first part of a space laboratory before 2016, focusing on breakthroughs in living conditions for astronauts and research applications, the spokesman said.The country would develop and launch a core cabin and a second laboratory module around 2020, which would be assembled in orbit around the earth into a manned space station, he said.\"Technologies needed to build and run the space station complex and long-term manned space flight in terrestrial space will be grasped,\" the spokesman said.China planned to launch two unmanned space modules, Tiangong-1 and Shenzhou-8, in 2011, which were expected to accomplish the country\u0027s first space docking and were regarded as an essential step toward building a space station.Tiangong-1, or Heavenly Palace, would eventually be transformed into a manned space laboratory after experimental dockings with Shenzhou-8, Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 spacecraft with the last two carrying two or three astronauts each. \t\t\t\t\t\t |  |",
