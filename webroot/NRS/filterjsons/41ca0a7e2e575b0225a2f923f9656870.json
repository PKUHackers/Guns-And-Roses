  "cleanContent": "By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishVietnamese police dispersed demonstrators at a fresh anti-China protest in capital Hanoi and detained at least 20 people on Sunday.Gathering in defiance of police warning, about 30 activists shouted \"Down with China\u0027s aggression!\" and waved Vietnamese flags and banners at 9 am Sunday morning.Vietnam authorities deployed heavy police presence around the Chinese embassy.AFP, citing witnesses, reported that at least 20 demonstrators were detained by the police and “forced into waiting buses and taken to a rehabilitation center usually used to detain sex workers and drug users”.The protest is the fourth such rally in just over a month to be staged by “activists” in Hanoi. No arrests were made at the previous three.Analysts say most of the demonstrators are “dissidents”, who, in the name of safeguarding “sovereignty”, actually directed the spearhead at the Vietnamese government. Besides organizing anti-China rallies, they are frequently seen in other illegal gatherings.Related news:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
