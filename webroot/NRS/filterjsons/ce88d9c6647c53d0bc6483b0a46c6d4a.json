  "cleanContent": "BEIJING, Aug.5 (Xinhuanet) -- China has expressed its strong opposition on the press statement released Friday by the U.S. Department of State on the South China Sea. Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang says the statement completely ignored the facts and deliberately sent a wrong signal.The United States on Friday voiced concerns about rising tensions over South China Sea. It singled out China for criticism - citing its establishment of Sansha city and garrison.On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang responded with strong dissatisfaction and opposition. He said the statement deliberately confounded right and wrong and sent a seriously wrong signal. Qin said China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters.China set up administrative offices in Xisha, Nansha and Zhongsha Islands in 1959. Now setting up Sansha city is the Chinese government’s necessary adjustment of the current administrative agencies.Qin said the US’ concern runs against the attitude of ’no position’ and ’no intervention’ that they claimed to hold on the South China Sea issue, and it is not conducive to the unity, cooperation, peace and stability in the region.On the same day, China’s Assistant Minister of Foreign affairs Zhang Kunsheng, urged the US to respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and act in the interests of the Asia Pacific region.Related news:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
