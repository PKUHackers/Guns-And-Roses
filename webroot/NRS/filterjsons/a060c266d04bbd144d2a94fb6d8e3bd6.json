They are scheduled to arrive in the waters off Diaoyu Islands on June 26. No landing plan is yet to be reported.As part of the purchase plan, these Assembly members will carry out fishing activities and have close inspections on the Diaoyu Islands with the assistance of the local fishermen.Six Japanese lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties viewed the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea on June 10, 2012, ahead of a parliamentary hearing on Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara\u0027s plan for the metropolitan government to purchase the islands, now in the possessions of private owners.China has strongly condemned the unilateral provocation from the Japanese side, as the Diaoyu Islands has been indisputable part within its territory since ancient times.Related news:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
