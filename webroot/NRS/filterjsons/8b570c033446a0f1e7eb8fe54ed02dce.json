  "cleanContent": "LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- World number one Roger Federer on Sunday said he is expecting \"something special\" at the London 2012 Olympic Games.The Olympic tennis tournament will take place at Wimbledon, where Federer won his record-equalling seventh Championships earlier this month. He is competing in the men\u0027s singles and doubles evnets at the Games.London 2012 will be the Swiss player\u0027s fourth Games, and he has twice carried his nation\u0027s flag at the Opening Ceremony -- at Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008.Federer won the men\u0027s doubles title in Beijing with Stanislas Wawrinka and the two will team up again for the defending campaign.Federe said: \"It\u0027s amazing to me that this is already my fourth Olympics. Always something special has happened at every Olympic Games I\u0027ve taken part in, and obviously I learned a lot as well -- like living in the Village, carrying the flag, responsibilities, seeing huge press rooms, facing a lot of pressure, winning gold.\"I just made the cut back in 2000. I was still very young then. I was only 18, 19. I was obviously able to make the Olympics. That was a big deal for me. There were a lot of things that I was able to take away from the Olympic Games. I hope it\u0027s going to be something similar this time.\"I was in central London recently and I did see they were preparing a big square for the Olympics, which I\u0027m sure are going to be amazing.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
