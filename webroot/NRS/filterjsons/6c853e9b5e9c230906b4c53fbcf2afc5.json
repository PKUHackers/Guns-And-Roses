  "cleanContent": "Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Thursday said the lower-level delegations that China sent to Tokyo for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank were‘completely appropriate\u0027, given current tense China-Japan relations over the Diaoyu Islands territorial row.Yang made the remarks while meeting with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle on the one-month anniversary of a major diplomatic standoff between Asia\u0027s largest economic powers. Japan on Sept 11 finalized an illegal \u0027purchase\u0027 of the islands, which have belonged to China for centuries.Observers have warned that the territorial dispute\u0027s growing effect on bilateral trade and Japan\u0027s domestic economy will not be reversed unless Tokyo takes necessary steps to correct its mistake. IMF Chief Christine Lagarde said on Thursday that China will \u0027lose out\u0027 by not sending its top two finance officials to the global economic talks this week. She also called on Beijing and Tokyo to settle the row quickly, as \u0027countries in this region are very important for the global economy\u0027.Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People\u0027s Bank of China, will deliver a speech on Sunday in place of bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan. The Chinese delegation will be led by Zhu Guangyao, vice-minister of finance, suggesting that Finance Minister Xie Xuren will also miss the conference.The no-shows of some of China\u0027s financial chiefs is a muted protest against Japan, Japan\u0027s Kyodo News Agency said.Jin Baisong, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation under the Ministry of Commerce, said Japan is using the platform of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings to play up a scenario of a potential economic crisis if the two economies resort to retaliation and trade wars.Such a scenario is unlikely, however, he said.\u0027The Diaoyu Islands dispute will hardly lead to an overblown global crisis, as Beijing has not ever brought out any formal retaliatory measures, and Chinese consumers\u0027 boycott against Japanese products is just natural and spontaneous,\u0027 Jin said.Also on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei refuted Japanese media reports that goods exported to China from Japanese companies were \u0027delayed\u0027 during customs clearance. \u0027We have noticed the reports, which according to relevant departments, were inconsistent with the facts,\u0027 Hong told a daily news conference.Chinese customs authorities have been clearing the goods \u0027in accordance with due process\u0027 and normal regular inspections, the spokesman said.Meanwhile, prominent figures and observers in Japan said Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, facing both bitter spats with neighbors and lasting poor public support, has a \u0027shrinking chance\u0027 of winning his upcoming re-election bid.Japan\u0027s leading newspaper, Sankei Shimbun, on Thursday called Noda\u0027s decision to \u0027nationalize\u0027 the Diaoyu Islands a \u0027miscalculation\u0027.And Mainichi Shimbun, another leading paper in the country, regarded Chinese government vessels\u0027 recent continued patrols in the waters off the islands as \u0027a constant move for protest\u0027.Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, earlier this week blasted Noda for the frayed ties with China, which have adversely affected the domestic economy, and he called for an early dissolution of the lower house to kick off the general election.Yonekura, a powerful economic figure in the country, also told Shinzo Abe, leader of Japan\u0027s main opposition Liberal Democratic Party and former prime minister, that he hopes the LDP will repair China-Japan ties.Beijing on Thursday rejected Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba\u0027s recent remarks that denied Chinese sovereignty over the islands before the 1970s, and added that some materials that Gemba used to justify Japan\u0027s actions were fragmented and taken out of context.In the presence of reporters on Wednesday, Gemba had resorted to a letter sent to a Japanese individual from the consulate of the then-Republic of China in Nagasaki in 1920, and a Chinese map published in 1960.Scholars from both China and Japan have conducted comprehensive and rigorous studies about the history of Japan\u0027s stealing of the islands from China in the 1895 Sino-Japanese war.Qu Xing, president of the China Institute of International Studies, said the maps Gemba mentioned were based on sources and materials from publishing organizations controlled by Japan during its invasion of China in the 1930s and 1940s, and most of Gemba\u0027s so-called proof just reflects Japan\u0027s militarist past.Related:Special Coverage:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
