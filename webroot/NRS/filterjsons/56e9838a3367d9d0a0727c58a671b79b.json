  "cleanContent": "DAMASCUS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The UN Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) said that it is \"alarmed\" by the recent attacks on the pro-government al-Ekhbariah TV that left seven people killed, calling on all parties to protect the journalists as noncombatants.\"The UN mission is alarmed at the attacks Wednesday on al- Ekhbariah TV,\" Sausan Ghosheh, the mission spokeswoman told reporters following the incident.\"Attacks on journalists and media outlets are utmost concern of the UN mission,\" said Ghosheh, urging all parties to protect and respect the freedom of expression, particularly the freedom of the press.Armed groups attacked the headquarters of al- Ekhbariah TV in a suburban area of the Syrian capital of Damascus after daybreak Wednesday. The armed men fired RPGs on the security guards before making their way inside the station, witnesses told Xinhua, adding that after several gunshots inside, loud sound of explosion rattled the area.The armed groups blasted the newsroom and broadcast station in an effort to paralyze the TV station.After the blast, the gunmen brought the victims, tying their hands behind their backs, forcing them to get down on their knees facing the exterior walls of the building, before executing them.Blood stains were seen splattered on the wall and the ground, where the execution took place, as the news and broadcasting rooms seemed reduced to rubles.Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi condemned the attack and the attempts of outside parties trying to silence the voice of the Syrian media.The ministers\u0027 remarks were made during a sit-in in front of the official Syrian TV Corporation in Damascus, which was held by hundreds of local journalists to protest against the deadly assault on al- Ekhbariah TV.The Arab League has recently asked the Nilesat and Arabsat satellite operators to stop the Syria TV channels. The decision was vehemently condemned by the Syrian government which accused the 22-member league of trying to mute the voice of the Syrians.A day earlier, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said his country is \"in a state of real war.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
