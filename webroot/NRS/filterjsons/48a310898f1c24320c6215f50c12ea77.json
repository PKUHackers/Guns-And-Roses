  "cleanContent": "By Mei Jingya, Sina EnglishShinzo Abe, head of Japan’s main opposition the Liberal Democratic Party （LDP）and former Prime Minister, voiced tough stance over the China-Japan Diaoyu dispute during his meeting with the U.S. deputy Secretary of State Williams Burns.According to Japanese media reports, hawkish Abe held talks with the No.2 US diplomat at the LDP headquarters and asked him to “accurately” pass on a message to Chinese officials: Japan will not yield a single centimeter of its territory to China.Abe was quoted by Jiji press as saying “there is no room for talk\" with China, because no territorial dispute exists surrounding the islands.Abe reportedly also expressed discontent with Washington’s stance on the spat, accusing it of keeping neutral while claiming at the same time the islands are covered by Japan-U.S. security treaty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
