  "cleanContent": "Japan and the United States are mulling a joint military drill to simulate retaking a remote island from foreign forces, reports said Sunday, amid a festering row between Tokyo and Beijing over disputed islets.The exercise, part of broader joint maneuvers to start in early November, would use an uninhabited island in Okinawa, southernmost Japan, Jiji Press and Kyodo News agencies quoted unidentified sources as saying.The drill would involve Japanese and US troops making an amphibious and airborne landing to retake the island using boats and helicopters, Kyodo said.Japan and China have long been at loggerheads over the sovereignty of rocky outcrops in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu Islands in China and Senkakus called by Japan.The disputed islands chain is uninhabited, but is thought to be sitting on top of valuable resources.Tension flared in August and September with landings from both sides and the subsequent \"nationalisation\" of the islands by Tokyo.The exercise would reportedly use the uninhabited island of Irisunajima. The tiny island, used as a firing range for U.S. forces, is also in the East China Sea but hundreds of kilometres (miles) away from the Diaoyu Islands.Jiji said some Japanese and U.S. government officials were cautious about holding the drill, fearing a likely angry response from China.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
