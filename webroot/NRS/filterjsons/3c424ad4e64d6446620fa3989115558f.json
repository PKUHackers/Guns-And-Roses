[Photo/Xinhua] \u003c/h4\u003e\t\tBEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- China\u0027s first space lab module Tiangong-1 blasted off at 9:16 p.m. Beijing Time (1316 GMT) Thursday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center located in China\u0027s northwest desert area.The unmanned module, carried by the Long March-2FT1 rocket, will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year, paving the way for China to operate a permanent space station around 2020 and making it the world\u0027s third country to do so.Commander-in-chief of China\u0027s manned space program Chang Wanquan announced the launch\u0027s success at the control center.Unlike previous Chinese space vehicles, Tiangong-1 has a docking facility which allows it to be connected to multiple space modules in order to assemble an experimental station in low Earth orbit.Tiangong-1 will orbit the Earth for about one month, awaiting the arrival of the Shenzhou-8 unmanned spacecraft. Once the two vehicles successfully rendezvous, they will conduct the first space docking at a height of 340 kilometers above Earth\u0027s surface.After two docking tests with the Shenzhou-8, Tiangong-1 will await Shenzhou-9, followed by Shenzhou-10, which will possibly carry a female astronaut, in the next two years, according to the plan for China\u0027s manned space program.If the astronaut in the Shenzhou-10 mission succeeds with the manual space docking, China will become the third nation after the United States and Russia to master the technology.President Hu Jintao watched the launch from the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center on Thursday, two days before China\u0027s National Day, witnessing the latest endeavor of China\u0027s manned space program since 1992.Other members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, including Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang and Zhou Yongkang, were also present.Premier Wen Jiabao and He Guoqiang, also members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, went to the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center to watch the launch process.\"Tiangong-1 has gone into the dark sky! We Chinese are on the way to inhabiting the vast universe,\" wrote Qichaoxiguanghai on Sina Weibo, China\u0027s most popular microblog service provider.\"I heard the news of Tiangong-1\u0027s launch from the radio on a ship to Yangzhou,\" wrote microblogger Xingfufeiafei. \"I am proud to share the pride that shakes the world. The pride of our nation is once again deep in my heart.\"With a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to conduct research and experiments in the future, China\u0027s first space lab module is hardly the size of any palace.But its name Tiangong-1, or \"Heavenly Palace-1,\" speaks of a dream home from Chinese folklore, long envisioned as a secret place where deities reside.Thanks to an economic boom that has continued since the end of 1970s, the Chinese government approved and began carrying out its three-phase manned space program in January 1992.The first phase, to send the first astronaut to space and return safely, was fulfilled by Yang Liwei in the Shenzhou-5 mission in 2003. After another two astronauts made successful extravehicular activities in the Shenzhou-7 mission in 2008, China entered the second phase of its space program: space docking.If the previous two steps succeed, China plans to develop and launch multiple space modules, with a goal of assembling a 60-tonne manned space station around 2020 in which Chinese astronauts will start more research projects in space.The success of Thursday\u0027s launch of Tiangong-1 also eased the pressure on China\u0027s space engineers following the unsuccessful lift-off in August when a Long March-2C rocket malfunctioned and failed to send an experimental satellite into orbit.To acquire a new and bigger rocket capable of loading a future space station\u0027s components that will be much heavier than Tiangong-1, research and development on a carrier rocket that burns more environmentally-friendly liquid-oxygen-kerosene fuels is in progress.Zhang Shancong, deputy chief designer of Tiangong-1, told Xinhua that the module carries special cameras which will take hyperspectral images of China\u0027s vast farmlands to detect heavy metal pollution and pesticide residue as well as plant disease.Moreover, scientists on the ground will also conduct experiments on photonic crystal, a new material expected to revolutionize information technology, in the low-gravity environment inside Tiangong-1 as these experiments would be extremely difficult to conduct on Earth\u0027s surface.\"China is clearly becoming a global power and its investments in areas like technology and exploration reflect this,\" said Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.\"It is a natural result of the growth in political and economic power and is to be expected,\" Singer said in an interview with Xinhua conducted via email.\"What remains at question is what kind of presence China will play on the international stage, cooperative, working with international partners, or going it alone?\" Singer said.The scholar, however, can find an answer to his question from the words of Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China\u0027s manned space program.Zhou told Xinhua that China will turn its future space station into an international platform for space research and application.\"The Chinese nation has pursued peace since ancient times,\" Zhou said. \"China\u0027s ultimate intention with the space program is to explore space resources and make use of them for mankind\u0027s well-being.\"A space station could provide a low-gravity environment for research on geography, astronomy and bio-technology, which will bring unimaginably greater achievements than those conducted on Earth\u0027s surface, he said.China has expressed its strong willingness to cooperate with other countries in exploring space. So far China\u0027s Long March rocket series has successfully sent more than 20 satellites into space for the United States, Australia, Pakistan and other countries and regions.One Chinese scientist and five international peers have also participated in Russia\u0027s Mars-500 Program, a ground-based experiment simulating a manned expedition to Mars.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
