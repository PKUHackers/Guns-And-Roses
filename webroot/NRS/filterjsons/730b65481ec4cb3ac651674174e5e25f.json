Russia and China, two permanent members of the UN Security Council, wielded veto power Thursday over a Western-proposed draft resolution on Syria. (Xinhua/Shen Hong)\u003c/h4\u003e\t\tUNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China, two permanent members of the UN Security Council, wielded veto power Thursday over a Western-proposed draft resolution on Syria.The draft demands extension of the UN Supervision Mission in Syria (UNSMIS) for a period of 45 days, and threatens non-military sanctions by quoting Chapter VII of the UN Charter if the Syrian government fails to pull out troops and heavy weapons from populated areas.The unadopted resolution received eleven votes in favor, two against and two abstentions.The draft demands \"all parties in Syria, including the opposition, immediately cease all armed violence in all its forms, thereby creating an atmosphere conducive to a sustained cessation of violence and a Syria-led political transition.\"It further indicated that if the Syrian authorities have not fully complied with the above requirement within 10 days, the Council \"shall impose immediately measures under Article 41 of the UN Charter.\"The Article 41 gives the Council a right to employ economic and diplomatic sanctions -- not involving the use of armed force -- to give effect of its decision and may call member states to apply such measures.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
