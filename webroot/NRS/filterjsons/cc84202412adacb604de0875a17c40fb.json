It said the line will rework again in few days.Several oil and gas pipelines have been targeted since the eruption of anti-government protests last year, causing losses estimated at millions of U.S. dollars.In a separate incident on Monday, a law-enforcement member was killed and two others were injured in an armed assault at a border guards post in northeastern Hasaka province, local media said.On the opposition side, the activists\u0027 network, Local Coordination Committees, said army troops continued shelling al- Haffeh area near coastal Latakia province Monday using tanks and helicopters \"in an attempt to storm the town.\"Al-Haffeh has been the scene of armed conflict between armed rebels and government troops.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
