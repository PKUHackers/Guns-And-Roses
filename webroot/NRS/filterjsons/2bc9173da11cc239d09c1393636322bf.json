Security Council, as called for by the Arab League last weekend,\" he said, referring to U.N. resolutions that authorize actions including the use of force.The first meeting of the International Working Group on Sanctions against Syria was held in Paris in April.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|  |",
